### Headless CMS

A headless content management system, or *headless CMS*, is a back-end only content management system (CMS) built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via a RESTful API for display on any device.

The term *headless* comes from the concept of chopping the head (the *front-end*, i.e. the website) off the body (the *back-end*, i.e. the content repository).
